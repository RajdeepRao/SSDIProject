## DESCRIPTION

### Overview and Motivation 
Currently   there   is   no   Standard,   Uniform   and   Equal   Opportunity   system   in   place   at   UNC  
Charlotte   to   find   Teaching/Research   Assistants.   We   believe   that   it   is   imperative   to   find   the  
best   candidate   for   a   position   by   bringing   the   demand   and   supply   together.   In   the   process   we  
also   aim   to   introduce   more   transparency   in   the   system   and   encourage   greater   collaboration  
between the Professors, University and Students.  

### Scope and Objectives 
We   intend   to   create   a   platform   to   be   used   by   the   Students   to   find   opportunities,   by   the  
Professors to scout talent and the university to manage resources. 
 
Student
Each   Student   will   create   a   profile.   The   student   profile   will   have   his   entire   information  
(personal,   professional,   academic,   skills,   opportunities   he   is   looking   for   etc).   The   student   can  
browse   TA   and   RA   positions   postings   (open   and   archived   both).   The   student   can   apply   for  
open positions provided he clears the prerequisite conditions set by the professor. 
 
Professor   
Each   Professor   will   create   a   profile.   The   professor   can   list   out   his   interests   and  
academic/research information on his pages.  
The   Professor   creates   an   opening   for   a   position   in   his   group.   The   Professor   can   set   a   test  
(MCQâ€™s,   Descriptive   questions,   Behavioural   questions,   Case   Studies,   Programming   tasks  
etc)   and   allow   students   to   work   on   the   test.   The   Professor   can   then   offer   the   position   to   a  student who meets his criteria. 
 
University 
The   University/Department   can   keep   track   of   the   positions   and   fulfill   necessary  
administrative tasks associated with this hiring.
